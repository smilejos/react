# Chat

Our [chat example](https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples/tree/master/chat) application is a port of
[Flux's chat example](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat). We've taken
that example and made it isomorphic.

If you're interested in the process of making the chat example isomorphic, you can take
a look at the [Bringing Flux to the Server](/guides/bringing-flux-to-the-server.html) article. This
is a step by step rundown of how we made Flux isomorphic with the chat as an example.
